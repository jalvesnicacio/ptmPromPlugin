# PtmPromPlugin
A plug-in for ProM utilising BeepBeep  PatTheMiner Palette. PtmProMPlugin Project is a plug-in that works in the [ProM program](http://www.promtools.org) and is able to inform when instances of a process are distant from a certain behavior trend.

PTM-ProM works using the [BeepBeep library](http://liflab.github.io/beepbeep-3/) and [PatTheMiner](https://github.com/liflab/PatTheMiner), a real-time data mining palette for the BeepBeep event stream processor.
